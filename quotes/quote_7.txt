    *No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:*

    *"That is not dead which can eternal lie,*

    *And with strange aeons even death may die."*
